# @serialport/bindings

The bindings package has been renamed [`@serialport/bindings-cpp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@serialport/bindings-cpp) and it's code has been moved out of the monorepo to it's [own repository](https://github.com/serialport/bindings-cpp/).

This version of `@serialport/bindings` is identical to the previous release but is deprecated to alert users of the name change.
