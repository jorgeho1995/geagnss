BKG NTRIP Client Version 2.12.18 (Rev. 9505)

The statically linked executable has been compiled on Linux using

Distribution: Debian 8.0, x86_64
Kernel      : 3.10-3-amd64
Compiler    : gcc (Debian 4.8.1-10) 4.8.1
Qt          : QMake version 2.01a Using Qt version 4.8.6

Running this static library BNC build does not require a Qt
installation on your system. However, it can't support Google Maps (GM)
and Open StreetMap (OSM) usage which is an optional part of BNC's
Precise Point Positioning. GM/OSM usage requires a shared library
BNC build.

If you are not familiar with the BNC program, we suggest to start
with the Readme.txt file in the Example_Configs directory.
See bnchelp.pdf for further information.
