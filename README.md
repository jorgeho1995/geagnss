This repository contains the code for my doctoral thesis.

## Description

GEA is a specialized tool designed to process raw GNSS data collected from Android devices. This application offers two primary functions: storing raw GNSS data for further analysis at a later time and enabling real-time positioning calculations through cloud computing. By empowering users to both archive data for future examination and perform instant positioning calculations, the GEA app emerges as a versatile solution for efficiently managing and utilizing GNSS information.
